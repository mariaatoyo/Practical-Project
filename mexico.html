  <div class="post-content">
  <p>
  Okay so the title of this post seems pretty radical, but I'm not joking when I say I've already encountered a few scenarios that could have so easily ended in disaster for me... 
</p>

  <p>
I write this post from the comfort of a cute cafe literally round the corner from my hotel, I'm talking less than a one minute walk away. I'm perfectly safe being sat here all by myself, but I can't say that's been true for the previous day in Mexico city. 
 </p>

  <p>
Before I left I told myself some basic rules to not get kidnapped or myself killed while in South America: 
1) don't talk to strangers who aren't on my tour. 
2) don't get into taxis that aren't UBER or that I haven't booked. 
3) don't drink the tap water. I know what you're thinking, how has this made it to the top 3 of Steph's survival rules? Well, funny story, I didn't get the vaccine which protects you if you pick up something from dodgy water. It was £50 and I wasn't prepared to part with that kinda money for an angry nurse to stab me which in turn will probably make me faint. No thank you. 
 </p>
  
  <p>
But this is where the problem arises, within less than 1 hour of being in Mexico I did all of the above. Yes, ALL OF THEM. It took me an hour to get through immigration and when I got out the other side my lovely and safe transfer which I had booked was nowhere to be seen. I'd been awake nearly 24 hours and just wanted to be in my hotel room. So what did I do? I approached the first Mexican man I could find of course. He then sorted a taxi out for me and done, before I knew it I was in a taxi supposedly heading to my hotel, but I couldn't guarantee this because I don't actu,ally know a word of Spanish: I let this man I met all of 5 minutes ago put me in a taxi.

But here's the thing, and where only this situation would happen to me. He turned out to be a genuinely amazing guy. He wasn't dodgy. He didn't want to kidnap me. And he even showed me round Mexico city the following day. I don't know how I did it but I managed to find a decent Mexican man within an hour of arriving in Mexico. Who'd have known?
So what have I already learnt about myself in these first 2 days? For one, I'm incredibly naïve and trusting for my own good. This guy could have turned out to be anyone and within my first day in South America I could have been a goner. Anthony, if you're reading this, thank you so much for not killing me, I will forever be eternally grateful for meeting such a lovely person. And secondly, just buy the goddamn bottled water and DEAL WITH IT. 
 </p>
 
  <p>
I understand that this blog post isn't exactly reassuring to those who want to see me home safe and sound on 18th November. I still have another 73 days to survive in this crazy continent and if these past 2 days are anything to go by... I can't guarantee that. Sorry Tilly love you xxx 
 </p>
 
  <p>
However, I managed to land on my feet and simultaneously reinforced the notion that spending tonnes of money on booked tours was 100% the right thing for me to do. 
 </p>
 
  <p>
On that safe and reassuring note, I'm done. Here is my first few hours in Mexico perfectly summarised. In all honesty, I wouldn't have done anything differently and I'm not sorry for that!
Love always, 
Steph x
 </p>

PS, Anthony also got all the angles and endorsed my tourist vibes- LAD.
