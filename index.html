<h1> 5am departures and 10 hour travel days </h1>
<p>The unglamarous side of traveling which no one tells you about on Instagram...

The 13 hour overnight buses, the 4am and 5am starts, the 10 hours spent on a minibus. All of which a lovely sunset picture on Instagram does not convey, although it does slightly compensate for said journeys.

I began writing this blog post at the most casual boarder crossing I have encountered thus far, and that's really saying something given our experience crossing from Guatemala and into El Salvador.
 We arrived by boat, nothing more than an old speed boat, maybe slightly bigger, with 15 plastic chairs bolted to it. Ya know the plastic chairs from primary school? Yeah those ones. Some locals helped us with our bags in exchange for a couple dollars and we waited.
 We filled in some immigration forms and handed our passports to Mario, our 10/10 tour leader, and we waited some more. Did I have to go in to the immigration 'office' to show someone my face and match it with my passport?
 No. Did they bother to search our bags for suspicious white powders?
 Also no. Did the 'office' resemble an abandoned warehouse which would probably be used for illegal raves in London? Yes. Yes it most certainly did.</P>

<h1> 2. </h1> 
<p>Do NOT let the content rely on a particular viewport width to render well - Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary widely between devices, content should not rely on a particular viewport width to render well.</p>

3. Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and large screens - Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements will cause the element to be too wide for the viewport on a smaller device. Instead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be careful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to fall outside the viewport on small devices.</p>
