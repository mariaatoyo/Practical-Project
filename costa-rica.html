  <h1 class="post-title">Are the infamous zip lines of Costa Rica really as good as the hype?</h1>
  
  <div class="post-content">
  <p>
  I've never been one to beat around the bush. I'm usually blunt, direct and to the point. So I'm gonna start this blog post by answering the question posed in the title. Yes. Yes they really are.

  <p>
A few days ago we headed to 100% Adventura, home to the longest zip line in all of Latin American: it's 800m long, in case you're wondering. Yes, that's nearly 1km. Almost one entire kilometre of zip lining fun. And I recorded every second of it on my gopro, my fabulous commentary and all.
	</p>
	
	<p>
We arrived at reception, paid $50 ($50 very well spent) and I popped to the bathroom. Yes, this is a necessary part to the day because when I came out one of the guides called 'are you ready?' to me, harness prepped and waiting. I replied 'yeah one second!' as I darted back to reception to pop my bag with the lady behind the desk. Because I had said 'yes' while running away, some of the guides started laughing, because apparently that's a sign of my fear. But okay, I see how today's gonna go, I'll be on the receiving end of everyone's jokes, guides included. It wouldn't be the first time and it certainly won't be the last time and I'm perfectly okay with this. Everyone needs someone to laugh at from time to time. I just didn't realise how often I would give people a reason to laugh today.
	</p>
	
	<p>
We all had our harnesses ready, my gopro was attached to my helmet and we headed round the corner for instructions. It was at this point that I realised the go-ape experience I had back in April with Ellie, shouts for the most random but also most fun 21st birthday present ever, was much needed preparation for this day. Instead of panicking over the height of these ziplines, some of which are enormous and only the gopro footage will show this, I panicked back in April. I knew what to expect and I was ready for fun, not for worrying.
	</p>
	
	<p>
The teasing and laughter started with the first zip line. The smallest, little baby zipline to slowly get us prepped for the monster awaiting us at the end. There were guides at every line who attached us and got us on and off the lines, meaning we really had to do nothing but fly around in the trees of Monteverde, Costa Rica- how fucking chill. But in order to get on these lines, one small, tight rope had to be attached. If you're a tall person I imagine this is less of a problem as your harness will automatically be closer to the zip line, but me? I'm barely 5ft3 and I had to hold onto the zipline and pull my entire body weight up in order for them to clip me in. I haven't been to the gym in much longer than I'm about to admit in this blog post. My lower body is also much stronger than my upper body so you can imagine how this went. I also had to do this seven times. S E V E N  T I M E S. And yes, I was aching the next day. Shoot me.

We carried on around the course, jumping from zipline to zipline until we had to cross a bridge. A bridge held together by slabs of wood which rocked from side to side, most definitely not strong and stable. Hayley was already running across the bridge and thought it'd be funny to jump as I'm taking my first tentative steps. Not okay. But worse? Liv had already caught up behind me and thought it'd be wonderful to do the same. This has been duly noted guys and I will get you back for this when I eventually make my way down under. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
After reaching a solid platform at the end of that rickety bridge I heaved a sigh of relief, it was onto the next zipline. Only it wasn't onto the next zipline at all. Hayley re-appears from god knows where with a grin on her face and knowledge in her eyes. A guide is telling me I'm 'going down there'. I stare at Hayley and say 'going where? Why do I have to do that? Hayley do I need to do this? What's going on?!' Hayley says nothing but grins, always fucking grinning! Next thing I know I'm attached to something and some guide is saying 'slow, medium or fast?' 'I dunno, medium?'. The next thing I know I'm falling to the ground beneath me, screaming of course. Now I know why the others stayed quiet. I walked back to them only to see them all smiling because they knew how I'd feel about that drop. The most annoying thing about it all? It was pointless. It was just for the bants. Fucking Costa Ricans doing that shit to me.
	</p>
	
	<p>
We had one more long zipline before the final two. The final two being the superman ziplines where you lay down as opposed to being in a seated position. Before jumping on a guide asked me 'how much do you weigh?' the cheeky fucker. Turns out you have to be at least 55kg to do the superman lines otherwise you get stuck because you're too light. Don't worry my Costa Rican amigo, there is more than 55kg to this mamacita, have no fear. I'd been perfectly chill and loving life so far. That was until the moment they strapped me onto the superman zipline and told me to lie myself down. I couldn't do it. I freaked and looked at my tour group for confirmation. Turns out I was worrying over nothing and it was one of the best experiences of my life. I was flying over the forest on the first superman zipline, already excited for the second and final one.
	</p>
	
	<p>
But I got stuck. I got fucking stuck. I realised way before the end that there was the potential I was going to be stranded god knows how many metres in the air over the Costa Rican forest. I was slowing down too much to see me through to the end. Luckily the guides also noticed this little mis-hap and one was already jumping onto the line to save me. Turns out maybe there's not much over 55kg on this bod, but who knows? I jump off and I'm ready for the next one, let's do this bitches.
	</p>
	
	<p>
I'm not nervous this time because I know what to expect. I know the speed and I know the angle at which to lie down. I stand on the block and when the guide says 'lie down', I freeze. I can't do it. Rachael and Mark are bent double laughing and the guide is looking at me with a 'fucking white people' look on his face. 'Just lie down', yeah mate what the fuck do you think I want to do? I don't know why but the thought of just dropping my body and hanging from a wire doesn't come naturally to me funnily enough. I ask for the guy's hand, I'm cute I know, and use it to slowly lie down, all the while Rachael and Mark offer me no support as they're too busy laughing, thanks lads! But it doesn't matter, I eventually get there and I'm whizzing through the forest again with a cheshire cat grin on my face and I'm as happy as can be.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Oh, and the best thing about all of this? I recorded it all on my gopro so you'll be able to see my views of the forest as well as me struggling to fly superman style when I upload it, you lucky people.

Love always,
