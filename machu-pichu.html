  I'm currently sat on the train to Machu Pichu with a million big thoughts racing through my mind. As I'm passing through the beautiful scenery of Peru, it's incredibly hard not to feel inspired, even for those who have little interest in traveling. Yeah little bro, I'm talking about you.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Ever since I was 18 and first went traveling, the standard interail around Europe avec bessie pal Jamie, I've had the travel bug. Even when at uni I always had plans to go away every summer meaning that by the age of 21, I'm currently on my fourth big trip. But as I sit here writing this, I realise my plans to delay my career and to just keep traveling are exactly what I should be doing with my life. Soz Tilly, but it looks like you're gonna have plenty of practice at not crying EVERY time I go away. Maybe one day you'll get the hang of it?
	</p>
	
	<p>
I've had an interesting few days with many thought-provoking conversations, especially the one with my current tour leader, Carlos. He's 33 and has worked many jobs, travelled all around the world and just generally followed his heart. When talking with him I realised I'm similar, but instead of following my heart I simply say 'fuck it', and that's kinda the same thing, right? I think that's why these thoughts have finally organised themselves in my brain. Whenever I go away, I always feel inspired to do something different with my life when I get home but when I land on British soil, I quickly find excuses as to why I can't act on these changes I want to make, namely EDUCATION. Well people, I no longer have that problem!

I never wanted to go to uni. In fact, I was very adamant that I would never go to uni. I knew from a young age I wanted to join the police and wanted to do so asap. However, when the time came to start thinking about leaving the safety net of education, I simply thought 'fuck that I'm not ready for adulting, let's go to uni yo'. Long story short, I last minute applied and three years later, I graduated with a decent grade from a decent uni, wham bam thank you mam.
	</p>
	
	<p>
BUT, three years later and I'm still not ready to properly 'adult'. So here it is, the big thoughts running around my mind which I already suspected, and kinda knew, were there before I left the UK: I just want to travel. It's that simple. My plans are to come back to the UK and work, then go away again. Then come back to the UK and work and go away again. I'm gonna keep doing this until I've been to every place I want to visit and that I'm completely satisfied. Only then will I consider adulting, but up until then I'm gonna stay living at home with my mumma and broski and my Henry because it's a pretty sweet deal at home. For those of you who know me, you'll know what when I say I'm gonna do something, I'm gonna fucking do it. So this is me saying 'I'm gonna fucking do it'.
	</p>
	
	<p>
I sit on the train to Machu Pichu smiling away in the knowledge that my next holiday is already booked. And I haven't even got home from my current trip yet. (Oh yeah mum, I'm going away again in a couple of months, if you want the details just drop me a WhatsApp message okay? Cool sweet). I also sit here with my notebook out, my favourite pen running out of ink from all the thoughts I've been jotting down and a list of the places I want to visit growing and growing. I'm pretty fucking content right now.
	</p>
	
	<p>
So, that's the plan lads. This isn't coming as a surprise to any of you and I know plenty of you will read this like 'yeah Steph we KNOW' but I just had to write it all down in a coherent way because recently, my mind has being running away from me. Now I feel more solid and safe in the knowledge of what I'll be doing with my life for the foreseeable. Actually writing it down and telling everyone, as opposed to my nearest and dearest, just makes it seem that little bit more real. But let's do this motherfuckers.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Love always, 
Steph x
