# Practical Project, Assignment 2 - IMAT34209
A website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a travel blog. The content taken from a 
a [Blogspot](http://stephfliessolo.blogspot.co.uk/?m=1)

Overall visually it looks basic, but the code is pretty good.

Found it difficult to make the website look apealing without using external sources such
as Webkit and Bootstrap. But happy i learnt to make a webiste without them. 

### The Four Principles of Web Accessibility
**Perceivable** **Operable** **Understandable** **Robust**

These priciples build the foundations of web accessibility and the beginning of WCAG 2.0.
Perceivable - referes to how parts must be clearly available. All non-text content on a web page must be available to the user in a way that is vsible to them. 
So this may include; images, inputs, audio or video files. The webpage cannot be inviible to all their senss, otherwise it would not be perceivable.
For example, if they cannot hear audio, then it must be readable.
Operable - page features should function in such a way th is possible for all users, so they ust be operable.
A guidline for this suggests that everthing must be keyboard accessible. Meaning that activation a deactivation is included so that keyboard users do not become trapped.
But mouse users should also not be hindered by this. they should still recieve full mouse support and special functionlities. But it should be possible for users not have to depend on this. 
Another principle of operable is that operations that are not real time cannot be timed. unless the operation tme is loner than twenty hours, then the user should be an option to adujest it, turn it off or extend the time.
