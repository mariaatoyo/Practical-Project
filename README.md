# Practical Project, Assignment 2 - IMAT34209
A website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a travel blog. The content is taken from a 
a [Blogspot](http://stephfliessolo.blogspot.co.uk/?m=1)

Overall visually it looks basic, but i think the code is pretty good.

Found it difficult to make the website look appealing without using external sources such
as Webkit and Bootstrap. But happy i learnt to make a website without them. 

### The Four Principles of Web Accessibility
**Perceivable,** **Operable,** **Understandable,** **Robust**
 
These principles build the foundations of web accessibility and the beginning of WCAG 2.0.

**Perceivable -** refers to how parts must be clearly available. All non-text content on a web page must be available to the user in a way that is visible to them. 
So this may include; images, inputs, audio or video files. The webpage cannot be invisible to all their senses, otherwise it would not be perceivable. For example, 
if they cannot hear audio, then it must be readable. 

**Operable -** page features should function in such a way that is possible for all users, so they must be operable. 
A guideline for this suggests that everything must be keyboard accessible. Meaning that activation a deactivation is included so that keyboard users do not become trapped. 
But mouse users should also not be hindered by this. They should still receive full mouse support and special functionalities. But it should be possible for users not have 
to depend on this. Another principle of operable is that operations that are not real time cannot be timed, unless the operation time is longer than twenty hours, then the 
user should be an option to adjust it, turn it off or extend the time. This principle also refers to preventing seizures and also navigable.

**Understandable -** for accessibility purposes the page and what it contains must be understandable, have predictability and input assistance. 
For example, documents must be readable, wat happens on the page should be expected and user errors should be given to the user and also a way to rectify the error.

**Robust -** this refers to a more technical aide of the webpage. This principle states that a page must be compatible. For example testing to make sure the code is valid and properly nested.
And even with older versions of HTML closing tags are still needed for the mark-up to be forward compatible.
