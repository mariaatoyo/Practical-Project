# Practical Project, Assignment 2 - IMAT34209
A website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a travel blog. The content taken from a 
a [Blogspot](http://stephfliessolo.blogspot.co.uk/?m=1)

Overall visually it looks basic, but the code is pretty good.

Found it difficult to make the website look apealing without using external sources such
as Webkit and Bootstrap. But happy i learnt to make a webiste without them.
